Please run the main file in PyCharm. The cleaned datafiles will be generated in the main project directory.
Make sure all the necessary libraries are installed.
The program reads the original _roads.tsv and BMMS_overview.xlsx from within the C:\YourPath\data\WBSIM_Lab1_2024\infrastructure.
Please make sure not to change these files.

To view the files, please put the cleaned files in the infrastructure folder and change their names to the already present files (without cleaned in it).
If you run the .jar file in the WBSIM_Lab1_2024 folder, the visualisation is done.
